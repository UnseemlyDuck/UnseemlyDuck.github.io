    Assignment 1 Code Blog (10/10/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>The first thing I learned for this assignment was, what the basic layout of an html file looks like. I had some issues pushing my code to github, but the lecture notes for github helped a lot. I am also still trying to figure out how to publish
    my files to the website. </p>

    Assignment 2 Code Blog (10/24/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    I found this assignment to be quite difficult.
    I went to a tutoring session for 290 (not a TA), and they weren't very helpful (they didn't understand css).
    Lecture notes were the most helpful along with some friends in the class who were also struggling.
    I personally struggled the most with the filter box.

    Assignment 3 Code Blog (11/07/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    This assignment was the most difficult for me thus far. First was figuring out how to unhide the modal box.
    Also having to clear the user's inputs took a lot of trial and error. 
    Lecture notes were very helpful along with Campuswire. One thing I googled was how to use the ".then" and ".catch" methods which was helpful for 
    verifying the modal data.
