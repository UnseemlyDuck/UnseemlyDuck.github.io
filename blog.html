  <p>The first thing I learned for this assignment was, what the basic layout of an html file looks like. I had some issues pushing my code to github, but the lecture notes for github helped a lot. I am also still trying to figure out how to publish
    my files to the website. </p>

    I found this assignment to be quite difficult.
    I went to a tutoring session for 290 (not a TA), and they weren't very helpful (they didn't understand css).
    Lecture notes were the most helpful along with some friends in the class who were also struggling.
    I personally struggled the most with the filter box.
