    Assignment 1 Code Blog (10/10/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>The first thing I learned for this assignment was, what the basic layout of an html file looks like. I had some issues pushing my code to github, but the lecture notes for github helped a lot. I am also still trying to figure out how to publish
    my files to the website. </p>

    Assignment 2 Code Blog (10/24/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    I found this assignment to be quite difficult.
    I went to a tutoring session for 290 (not a TA), and they weren't very helpful (they didn't understand css).
    Lecture notes were the most helpful along with some friends in the class who were also struggling.
    I personally struggled the most with the filter box.
  </p>

    Assignment 3 Code Blog (11/07/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    This assignment was the most difficult for me thus far. First was figuring out how to unhide the modal box.
    Also having to clear the user's inputs took a lot of trial and error. 
    Lecture notes were very helpful along with Campus wire. One thing I googled was how to use the ".then" and ".catch" methods which was helpful for 
    verifying the modal data.

    Assignment 4 Code Blog (11/14/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    This assignment had a rocky start since I was having issues installing node.js. I used the link provided in class and installed it from there. Whenever I tried to start my server it kept giving me an error saying it didn't know what 'node' was.
    After a lot of searching on the internet I found that my environment variables path for node.js was wrong. It was an easy fix after I found the reason. I wish the lecture notes mentioned a bit more about installing node.js and possible issues that could happen.
    Overall, the lecture notes were very helpful besides the installation step.
  </p>

    Assignment 5 Code Blog (11/28/2022)
  </h2>
  <p>
    This assignment was a struggle for me since I found the lecture notes to be a bit confusing. This is likely more my fault then the lecture notes. Campuswire was helpful since some questions I had were already answered there. 
    I struggled the most getting the post/n to work but I believe I was able to manage. Overall, learned a lot just a bit confusing.
